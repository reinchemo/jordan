# Nike-Ecomerce ðŸ‘Ÿ

I've builded a landing page from a **[Nike](https://www.nike.com/)** E-comerce shoes.

## About

This project was made for personal purposes, following the toturial from this **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1dz0xRbSJc)**.

It's a landing page template created by **[Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)**.

Was a little bit a challenging for me, but nothing is impossible.

#### **Air Jordan's**

Air Jordan is an American brand of basketball shoes, athletic, casual, and style clothing produced by Nike.
Founded in Chicago, Air Jordan was created for Hall of Fame former basketball player **[Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan)** during his time with the **[Chicago Bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls)**. 

The original Air Jordan sneakers were produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in late 1984, and released to the public on April 1, 1985. That shoes really deserves a place in the history, for all iconic feeling that brings with them.
